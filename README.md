# Brain Effective Connectome based on fMRI and DTI data: Bayesian Causal Learning and Assessment

This repository contains four main folders;

1- The BGOLEM folder contains the codes for running the Bayesian GOLEM method on the data.

2- The BFGES folder contains the codes for running the Bayesian FGES method on the data.

3- The Hybrid data generation folder contains the codes for generating hybrid data that uses theÂ DTI data to creat Directed Acyclic Graphs and then generate signals similar to the fMRI data.

4- The preprocessing folder contains the codes for running the preprocessing pipelines of DTI data for HCP data.

In some parts of our codes, we  have used the following files:
